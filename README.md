## About 

Trailers Demand Planner - program inspired by work experience of a freight forwarder.

Calculates a forecast how many trailers are to be ordered from a haulier by a freight forwarder based on previous data.
Additionally other options allow the user to preview the data, run unused haulage costs report with possibility of adding/deleting lanes. 

Its objective is to support everyday tasks of a freight forwarder.

### User Manual

<details><summary>Click for instructions</summary>

#### Main Menu
Opens with the program Consists of three main parts:
- Logo
- Options
- User input

Actions:
- Review and select one of the options by inputing the index number of the option confirming with enter.
- If an invalid option is selected the program will print: "Invalid Option, please try again" & "Press enter to return to the menu": 
    In this case user needs to press enter to see the main menu again and choose one of the options: 1 - 9 or 0

#### Option 1: Preview last loaded data
After choosing option 1 the program will print how many trailers were loaded for their corresponding lane,
Example 'Cork, IE->Dublin, IE': '0', which should be interpreted as 0 trailers were loaded during last operations on the Cork, IE->Dublin, IE lane.

Below the program prints "Press enter to return to the menu": to print the main menu press enter.

#### Option 2: Preview last planned data
Selecting Option 2 prints a reminder to pre-order trailers for next operations.
Example 'Cork, IE->Dublin, IE': '2', which means the user should contact a haulage opeartor to order 2 trailers.

The option can be used to check what was planned for the operations before running the daily trailer forecast (option 9) or
After the daily trailer forecast as a support when ordering trailers from haulage providers for next loading.

Below the program prints "Press enter to return to the menu": to print the main menu press enter.

#### Option 3: Preview last added_unused data
Option 3 displays how many trailers were unused (positive numbers) or ordered at the day (negative numbers) during last opeartions for each lane.
Example 1: 'Cork, IE->Dublin, IE': '2', means that 2 trailers were planned previosuly without the need and eventually were not loaded.
Example 2: 'Cork, IE->Reading, GB': '-1', there was one trailer loaded more than planned and the freight forwarder had to contact a haulage opeartor to order 1 trailer for loading on the day of operations.

Below the program prints "Press enter to return to the menu": to print the main menu press enter.

#### Option 4: Run unused haulage costs report
Choosing this option the user will be asked to confirm how much haulier operator will charge the freight forwarding company for cancelling loading at the day operations.
If the input is invalid the program will display an error: Invalid data, in case there the input is blank the program will assume €250 as default cancellation charge.

The program prints information how many trailers in total were unused and how much it cost and below same for most recent opearations only. 

Below the program prints "Press enter to return to the menu": to print the main menu press enter.

#### Option 5: Add a new lane & exit 
After selection of the option 5 the user will be requested to specify a name for the new lane to be added suggesting to follow same format: Cork, IE->Dublin, IE'
However, as some lane names may need to be a code/ serial number or other non-standard name that would allow the user to choose it according to the operational needs,
the user can enter any name of their choice besides empty or exact duplicate input which will be communicated to the user and will need to choose this option again to proceed.
<img src="docs/manual/option-5.png">
<img src="docs/manual/option-5-already-added.png">
When the user enter a name for the new lane then the program will print status updates on the progress: "Adding headings..." and "Updating worksheets"
The data under the heading of the new lane in all worksheets will be updated as 0 for previous operations and next day planning.
The program will then print a confirmation that the new lane has been added successfully.
The program closes to correctly access the updated data.

The user needs to re-open the application after the update to continue using the program.

<img src="docs/manual/option-5-added.png">

#### Option 6: Delete a lane & exit
When the user chooses this option firstly is able to preview lane names in the program, the program communicates to select a lane to be deleted.
The user can select the lane to be deleted by its index: the first lane from the left has index 1 and user needs to count the number to identfy the lane to be deleted.
The program also prints the range of indexes to choose from. The user is asked to enter index for example: 1, which must be confirmed by pressing enter key.

<img src="docs/manual/option-6.png">

When the user inputs index that does not exist, the program will inform that it was invalid  and reminds the user the range of indexes.

<img src="docs/manual/option-6-invalid-index.png">

In case the user input is a letter or blank, the program will inform that it needs to be a number with base 10:

<img src="docs/manual/option-6-invalid-index-alpha.png">

Once the correct index is entered, the program asks the user to confirm deleting lane of the chosen index. 
Entering no or n and pressing enter prints message that deleting lane has been stopped and displays the main menu.
If users confirms by typing yes or y confirmed by enter key then the program deletes the lane number 7 and informs the user.
The program closes to correctly access the updated data.

The user needs to re-open the application after the update to continue using the program.

<img src="docs/manual/option-6-invalid-lane-deleted.png">

At least one lane must be in the program so the user is prevented to delete the last one.
The user needs to enter one more lane using the option 5 to be able to delete the lane that remained as last one,
If no other lane is known, lane name such: "???" can be used temporarily while adding an extra one.

<img src="docs/manual/option-6-minimum.png">

#### Option 7: Clear RECENT non-default data & exit.

There is a minimum set of default numeric data: 6 rows for loaded and added_unused worksheets, and 7 rows for planned worksheet to provide some base data for calculations. 

The user can delete the most recent non-default data from all worksheets by choosing option 7. 
Once the option is chosen, the user is asked to confirm deleting LAST.

Typing no or n (in both cases input must be  in small cases) confirmed by enter inform that the action has been stopped and displays the main menu.

Input of yes or y (in both cases input must be  in small cases) and enter deletes the most recent non-default data or informs that no more data can be deleted from the program.

If the user inputs other data than y/yes or n/no the prgoram informs about invalid input and the user needs to return to the main menu by pressing enter.

<img src="docs/manual/option-7-invalid-confirmation.png">

The program closes to correctly access the updated data.
The user needs to re-open the application after the update to continue using the program.

<img src="docs/manual/option-7.png">
<img src="docs/manual/option-7-already-deleted.png">

#### Option 8: Clear ALL non-default data & exit

There is a minimum set of default numeric data: 6 rows for loaded and added_unused worksheets, and 7 rows for planned worksheet to provide some base data for calculations.

The user can delete all non-default data from all worksheets by choosing option 8. 
Once the option is chosen, the user is asked to confirm deleting ALL.

Typing no or n confirmed by enter inform that the action has been stopped and displays the main menu.

Input of yes or y and enter deletes all non-default data or informs that no more data can be deleted from the program.

If the user inputs other data than y/yes or n/no the prgoram informs about invalid input and the user needs to return to the main menu by pressing enter.

<img src="docs/manual/option-8-invalid-confirmation.png">

The program closes to correctly access the updated data.
The user needs to re-open the application after the update to continue using the program.

<img src="docs/manual/option-8.png">
<img src="docs/manual/option-8-already-deleted.png">

#### Option 9: Run daily trailer forecast & exit

Once the option 9 is selected by the user the program dispalys lane names and information about the required input: 
It must be as many numbers as many lanes in use, separated by commas: example: 1,2,3,4,5,6

The user must enter numbers of how many trailers were loaded during the last operations for the corresponding service in the same order as per the lane names list.
Example below: 2 trailers were loaded for the Cork, IE->Dublin, IE lane

<img src="docs/manual/option-9-example.png">

In case there is not enough, too many numbers or not a number was entered the program informs that the data is invalid until valid input is provided.

<img src="docs/manual/option-9-invalid-data.png">

Once the entered data is valid the program proceeds updating on the status of the process.
The program closes to correctly access the updated data.
The user needs to re-open the application after the update to continue using the program.

 <img src="docs/manual/option-9.png">

#### Option 0: Exit
This option closes the program.

14. As the site owner I want to ensure users operate with the most up to date data.

| Feature | Action  | Expected Result | Actual Result |
| ------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| Option 1: Preview last loaded data | From the main menu type 1 and confirm by pressing enter key | Users see a table of lane names with the corresponing number of loaded trailers lately (column headings with the data from the lowest cell of loaded worksheet) | Users access the most up to date data from loaded worksheet | Works as expected |
| Option 3: Preview last added_unused data | In the main menu type 3 and confirm by pressing enter key | Users see a table of lane names with the corresponing numbers: postive represent trailers unused, negative ordered at the day or zeros inform there was nothing left unloaded or had to be ordered extra to complete the operations (column headings with the data from the lowest cell of added_unused worksheet) |  Users access the most up to date data from added_unused worksheet | Works as expected |
| Option 5: Add a new lane & exit | In the main menu type 5 and confirm by pressing enter key, enter a name in any format or as recommended and press enter, once process is completed reopen the application and open any of the options that display lanes list (e.g. Option 1: Preview last loaded data) | The program displays the list of lane names, recommends the format of the input gives an example, once a new name(is not blank or exact same as one of the lanes) is entered then updates on the progress are printed, lane is added to all worksheets and program closes. After the automatic closing the users reopen the application and can see that new lane is added to the program | Works as expected |
| Option 9: Run daily trailer forecast & exit | In the main menu type 9 and confirm by pressing enter key, enter data representing how many trailers were used for the last oparations: as many numbers as many lanes planned, separated by commas and press enter. Once process is completed reopen the application and open Option 2: Preview last planned data | Users are presented with the list of planned lanes with printed instructions to correctly enter data, the program runs daily trailer forecast and closes program. After the automatic closing the users reopen the application select Option 2: Preview last planned data and see results of the automated forecast for next operations | Works as expected |
