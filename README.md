    In this case user needs to press enter to see the main menu again and choose one of the options: 1 - 9 or 0

#### Option 1: Preview last loaded data
After choosing option 1 the program will print how many trailers were loaded for their corresponding lane,
Example 'Cork, IE->Dublin, IE': '0', which should be interpreted as 0 trailers were loaded during last operations on the Cork, IE->Dublin, IE lane.

#### Option 2: Preview last planned data

#### Option 3: Preview last added_unused data
Option 3 displays how many trailers were unused (positive numbers) or ordered at the day (negative numbers) during last opeartions for each lane.
Example 1: 'Cork, IE->Dublin, IE': '2', means that 2 trailers were planned previosuly without the need and eventually were not loaded.
Example 2: 'Cork, IE->Reading, GB': '-1', there was one trailer loaded more than planned and the freight forwarder had to contact a haulage opeartor to order 1 trailer for loading on the day of operations.

#### Option 5: Add a new lane & exit 
After selection of the option 5 the user will be requested to specify a name for the new lane to be added suggesting to follow same format: Cork, IE->Dublin, IE'
However, as some lane names may need to be a code/ serial number or other non-standard name that would allow the user to choose it according to the operational needs,
the user can enter any name of their choice besides empty input which will be communicated to the user .
