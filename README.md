#### Option 1: Preview last loaded data

#### Option 3: Preview last added_unused data
Option 3 displays how many trailers were unused (positive numbers) or ordered at the day (negative numbers) during last opeartions for each lane.
Example 1: 'Cork, IE->Dublin, IE': '2', means that 2 trailers were planned previosuly without the need and eventually were not loaded.

#### Option 5: Add a new lane & exit 
After selection of the option 5 the user will be requested to specify a name for the new lane to be added suggesting to follow same format: Cork, IE->Dublin, IE'
